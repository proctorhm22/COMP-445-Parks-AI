File headings are included at the top of each file; each contains a breif description of what the file is used for. 

Some problem instances / their solutions are generated by default when you run main. All of the original levels can 
be found on the Logic Games app, and pictures of in-app solutions for key problem are located at the end of our 
slide deck. 

All 2-tree problems are solved as if they were 1-tree problems. 

verbosity:  0 no additional print statements
            1 print next_var, the value being assigned to next_var, and num_nodes_explored for each 
                    explored node; identifies if / how program backtracks
            2 print (1) along with domains and new_domains after each call to constraint propogation

Running problem instances by hand...

After placing a tree, block off the cells surrounding the tree, the rest of those in the row, the rest in the 
column, and the rest in the color. From what's left, decide where to put the next tree (MRV), and repeat.

        e.g.    B ____  B ____  V ____  G TREE  M ____

                B ....  B ....  V ____  V ____  M ____

                Y ....  B ....  V ....  M ____  M ....

                Y ....  Y ....  Y ....  M ____  M ....

                Y ....  Y ....  Y ....  Y ____  Y ....


                B ____  B ____  V ____  G TREE  M ____

                B ....  B ____  V ____  V ____  M ____

                Y ____  B ____  V TREE  M ____  M ____

                Y ....  Y ____  Y ____  M ____  M ....

                Y ....  Y ....  Y ____  Y ____  Y ....
