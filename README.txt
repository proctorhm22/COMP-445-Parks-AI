COMP 445 Research Project - Parks AI

"""Include a README file explaining how to use and interpret your program. It should include instructions on how
to run a (very) small problem instance where I can manually verify that your algorithm is finding the optimal
solution. That is, I can quickly run the search by hand on the small problem instance."""

FILES:  constraint_learning.py  
        forward_checking.py     
        main.py
        park.py

File headings are included at the top of each file; each contains a breif description of what the file is used for. 

Some problem instances / their solutions are generated by default when you run main. All of the original levels can 
be found on the Logic Games app, and pictures of in-app solutions for each problem are located at the end of our 
slide deck. 

verbosity:  0 no additional print statements
            1 print next_var, the value being assigned to next_var, and num_nodes_explored for each 
                    explored node; identifies if / how program backtracks
            2 print (1) along with domains and new_domains after each call to constraint propogation
